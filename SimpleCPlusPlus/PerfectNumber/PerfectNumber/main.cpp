 Greek mathematicians took a special interest in numbers that are equal to the sum of their proper
 divisors (a proper divisor of N is any divisor less than N itself). They called such numbers perfect
 numbers. For example, 6 is a perfect number because it is the sum of 1, 2, and 3, which are the
 integers less than 6 that divide evenly into 6. Similarly, 28 is a perfect number because it is the sum
 of 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14.
 
 Write a predicate function IsPerfect that takes an integer n and returns true if n is perfect, and
 false otherwise. Test your implementation by writing a main program that uses the IsPerfect
 function to check for perfect numbers in the range 1 to 10000 by testing each number in turn.
 When a perfect number is found, your program should print it. The first two perfect numbers are 6
 and 28, there are two others in the range to 10000.
