 For this problem, you will use the graphics library to explore an interesting phenomenon known as
 the "Chaos Game."
 Prompt the user to click three points within the graphics window. We'll refer to these points as A, B,
 C. Draw a triangle connecting A, B, and C. Now, follow these steps to fill in the triangle with points:
 1. Randomly choose one vertex (A, B, or C) as the current point
 2. Draw a small filled circle around the current point
 3. Randomly choose one vertex (A, B, or C) and move the current point half of the distance
 toward that vertex
 4. Repeat steps 2 & 3 (stop when the user clicks the mouse)
 After many iterations, you might expect this random process to produce nothing but an odd
 mishmash or that the points will eventually fill the entire triangle. Without giving too much away, I'll
 tell you that the resulting image never varies and will likely surprise you with its beauty and
 symmetry.
